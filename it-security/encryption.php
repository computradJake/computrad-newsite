                  <h2>Keeping your email communications safe and secure</h2>
                  <p>Email is the backbone of communications for many businesses globally. Because of this, email is highly susceptible to extremely harmful breaches of security; behind portable storage, email is the second most common source of data leakage. However, this statistic can be easily reduced by simply making sure all email traffic is secure and cannot be accessed by an unauthorised party.</p>
                  <p>It is likely that your business will already have some form of basic computer protection already in place, but without complete coverage, data can still be at significant risk. By using our Email Encryption service, you can ensure that all of your businesses critical information will remain protected and confidential.</p>
                  <p>Our Encryption services automatically scan your inbound and outbound content and block anything which raises concerns. Users can also opt to encrypt outgoing mail manually should they wish, depending on their email service.</p>
                  <p>Encryption will not disrupt your normal computer usage, meaning your business can continue to send emails, surf the internet and work on important documents without suffering any interruption or loss of performance.</p>
