                  <h2>Keeping you in control of your network traffic</h2>
                  <p>By examining your network traffic, Computrad can analyse patterns in communication in order to determine where your traffic is coming from, and if it is of any threat to your system.</p>
                  <p>Through our high quality Network Traffic Analysis system, we are able to ensure optimum performance across your network. Managing your network traffic means we can make sure critical applications and operations are performing as they should.</p>
                  <p>Downtime can be one of the most detrimental disturbances to a businessâ€™s operation, but our Network Traffic Analysis service reduces the chance of downtime or disruption on your system, as heavy traffic loads will be managed and failures will be eliminated.</p>
                  <p>Our service provides you with the ability to manage all traffic across your network, and divide priorities as you wish. This allows most business-critical applications and users to continue operating to their full potential, without suffering because of access being prioritised elsewhere.</p>
                  <p>We will track and eliminate points of failure and manage substantial traffic loads, reducing the chance of downtime or interruption to your service. SSL acceleration and TCP optimisation features will provide you with increased performance without a need to upgrade your existing infrastructure.</p>

                  <h2>Security protection</h2>
                  <p>Our service will fight off any threats to your system, including providing information to DDoS protection systems, and use encryption technologies to ensure data will remain secure. This means business managers need not spend their time worrying about the security of their data, as network access will be continually monitored for any breaches.</p>
                  <p>While we protect your network against security attacks, authorised users will still be able to access the network as usual, and their connection will continue to operate at full efficiency. We will alert you to those who should not be accessing the network, or are creating unusual activity, without making life difficult for the rest of your team.</p>
