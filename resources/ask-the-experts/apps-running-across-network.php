                  <h2>The Issue</h2>
                  <p>txIf you organization is fairly distributed with many business units and if your company might have even grown through several mergers or takeovers. So now your company network is a mix of many networks merged together but your business units are still running fairly independently.</p>
                  <p>However, everybody agrees that the WAN should be centrally controlled and managed on a common platform and infrastructure. The problem is that despite these agreed-upon objectives the independent business units have started of rolling-out new applications without informing you. You only have an approximate idea of applications running over your WAN or are sometimes informed after they have rolled-out, which causes  serious incidents of application performance deterioration and end users are complaining that the networks “does not work”</p>
