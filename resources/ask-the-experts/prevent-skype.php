                  <h2>The Issue</h2>
                  <p>Data leakage comes in many forms, from sending out confidential documents via email, msn and so forth to posting on blogs and forums. Data leakage can cost companies their reputation, their competitive advantages over their competitors and can also be liable to financial penalties depending on the nature of the documents / data being leaked. With so many exit points from the average network, how do you prevent or seriously minimise this?</p>

                  <h1 class="section-title">The Solution</h1>
                  <p>Computrad approach is really in one device – Not multiple devices! With our proven one box solution, Computrad can create rules that can scan packets for files types and key words at the network level, in real time. So ‘confidential’ or a company slogan can be recognised and an action can be performed. Computrad can also create rules against applications and application features.</p>
                  <p>For example</p>
                  <div class="row">
                  <div class="col-md-6">
                  <ul>
                  <li>Users can be given access to Skype but block file transfers within Skype.</li>
                  <li>Users can check their hotmail or Gmail for emails, but are unable to send an email or upload files to it</li>
                  <li>Users can download from collaborative websites, but cannot upload to it</li>
                  </ul>
                  </div>
                  <div class="col-md-6">
                  <ul>
                  <li>Users can be restricted to what file types go out over MSN, email and so on. E.g. Deny .PDF files but allow .DOC files</li>
                  <li>Users can even send, for example, word documents through MSN, or Skype but deny documents that have a certain pattern e.g. company confidential within the word document</li>
                  <li>All these rules can be applied do Windows AD users or Groups. Actions can be allow, deny, log, alert, hold and so on</li>
                  </ul>
                  </div>
                  </div>
                  <p>Computrad can give put you in control of your network. The key to control is visibility. This is what Computrad excels at.</p>

                  <h2>Computrad APT Prevention approach:</h2>
                  <p><b>Prevent Threats</b> – The threats will be detected and analysed in real time which will enable pro-active blocking and provide a high level of intelligence to understand the source of the attacks. This will enable constant ongoing protection and the system will get ‘smarter’ as more information about threats is logged.</p>
                  <p><b>Detect the threat</b> – The security threats we face today require a network architecture that has the ability to be aware of both multi-vector and multi-stage attacks. The Computrad APT solution can detect both known and evolving threats on a real time basis and can switch the protection to the correct load to match the demands of the network it is implemented within.</p>
                  <p><b>Contain the threat</b> – Containing security threats effectively requires live validation of the threats alongside the ability to put a stop to attacks when systems are compromised.</p>
                  <p><b>Resolve the threat</b> – Security threats will be examined, scoped and taken through to a resolution quickly in a way that is cost effective and that doesn’t impact on the flow of legitimate traffic.</p>
