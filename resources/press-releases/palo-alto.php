              <p class="lead">LONDON--(EON: Enhanced Online News)--Through a new strategic partnership   with Palo Alto Networks, Network and Security specialist Computrad (Europe) Holdings Ltd are introducing a fundamentally new concept in firewalling to   customers in Europe. Computrad are the founding partner in the UK and   currently have the highest level and amount of technical resource   available from any Palo Alto Networks partner in Europe. </p>


              <p>			    “When it comes to ensuring that applications are securely delivered,   we understand every business is unique and our security managed   services are designed to provide the tailored approached to meet our   customer's specific business needs” </p>
			  <p>			    Traditional firewalls are no longer sufficient to protect an   organisation from next generation threats. Enterprise networks are being   populated by a new generation of end-user applications, both personal   and business oriented, that are designed to evade detection by existing   firewall technology. These new applications have joined the many   enterprise applications that use similar evasion tactics, albeit in a   positive manner, to simplify widespread access and speed up   implementation cycles. The end result is that IT departments cannot   identify or control the applications that are flowing in and out of   their network. <br />
			    <br />
			    With traditional firewalls unable to “see” the increasing number   applications using sophisticated security evasion techniques such as   dynamic or random port numbers, and application emulation/tunnelling,   enterprise networks are rife with unapproved and uncontrollable   applications, bringing unwanted exposure to a wide range of security and   compliance-related risks. </p>
			  <h4>                Palo Alto Networks and Computrad’s Relationship Provides Strategic   Business Services </h4>
			  <p>                Palo Alto Networks’ family of next-generation firewalls enables more   effective risk management on enterprise networks by employing   business-relevant elements such as applications, users, and content as   the basis for policy control. With its next generation firewalls, Palo   Alto Networks addresses key shortcomings that plague traditional   Stateful Inspection-based firewalls--a reliance on port/protocol to   identify the applications and the assumption that IP address equates to a   users identity. </p>
			  <h4>                Palo Alto Networks, the first true Application Aware Perimeter   Firewall </h4>
			  <p>                As a longstanding specialist in Security and Application   optimization, Computrad’s leading product portfolio includes the likes   of Fortinet and Juniper, however for its new Application Aware Perimeter   Firewall managed service offering, Computrad turned to Palo Alto   Networks integrated multi-service platform as the only comprehensive   solution with the capability to provide the strategic solution required   to meet the needs of Computrad's managed service customers. <br />
                <br />
                &quot;When it comes to ensuring that applications are securely delivered,   we understand every business is unique and our security managed   services are designed to provide the tailored approached to meet our   customer's specific business needs,&quot; explains Johan Carstens, Director   at Computrad. <br />

&quot;As such, it was critical we chose a solution that could secure   every and any application, and unlike its competitors, Palo Alto   Networks can Identify all IP traffic, not just TCP ports. Palo Alto   Networks also stood apart from its competitors with its three unique   identification technologies to accurately identify the application,   mapping the application to the user identity whilst inspecting the   traffic for content policy violations. By focusing on business-relevant   elements such as applications, users and content for policy controls   Computrad’s Application security service is unique in the market with   its focus on the application’s itself not just TCP ports. <br />
