                    <p>It is widely known that the recruitment industry is based on a fast paced, time centric approach and having reliable IT in place can go a long way towards helping your business thrive within this environment.</p>
                    <p>An IT failure within a recruitment business could potentially lead to the loss of key clients and accounts, simply due to the fact that you may not be able to deliver what your client needs at a key point, causing them and you to lose out on all important fees and commission.</p>
