                  <p>As with new cars, unless you regularly service and maintain your vehicle, problems that could have been caught very early on have now evolved into costly repair bills.</p>
                  <p>IT Technology is no different. Buying a new server and walking away from it will certainly cause problems sooner than you think. Your server is the lifeline of your business; it houses your data, files, folders and runs your emails, smart phones and business critical applications. If your IT estate is not regularly “serviced”, then the risk of there being a problem will be high and the impact of this problem would more than likely hurt your business.</p>
                  <p>Even if you have an IT department in place, they may not be have the skills to solve many of the modern problems with IT systems. In most cases it will be unpractical and not cost effective to have an internal IT department.</p>
                  <p>Due to the complexity of the tasks and the costs involved, taking up a Managed IT Service will often be the best long term solution for the management of IT systems.</p>
                  <p>At Computrad, we are proud of our fully managed IT service and strive to deliver service excellence to all of our clients</p>
