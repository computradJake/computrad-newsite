                  <p>A 2 factor authentication solution is the new standard in device and network security.</p>
                  <p>Requiring two forms of authentication such as password and a digital token that needs to be scanned, the system will ensure that business devices and applications are 100% secure and only accessible by those who have both elements of the two-step verification process covered.</p>
                  <p>2 Factor authentication can be used to secure not just digital devices, but also web applications, web portals and many other online platforms in a very efficient and cost effective manner without all the usual overhead expenses associated with the installation and configuration of a two-step authentication platform.</p>
                  <p>Computrad’s 2-factor authentication solution provides complete function and management features, making your rollout quick and cost-effective, and it’s compatible with Windows and Linux operating systems on both 32-bit and 64-bit machines.</p>
