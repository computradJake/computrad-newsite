                  <h2>Keeping your team on the ball with Hosted SharePoint</h2>
                  <p>Computradâ€™s Hosted SharePoint service allows multiple users to easily access and edit shared content, an essential facility for businesses and the perfect tool for teams working together on collaborative projects</p>
                  <p>This versatile and easy to use service can be particularly useful if team members are often travelling or are based in different locations, providing them with a central point to work from and manage all their critical files.</p>
                  <p>Our Hosted SharePoint service provides users with the option to view documents before editing, view changes and revisions that have been made to documents and restore previous versions of them, as well as controlling the security access to the file.</p>

                  <p>The service provides full administrative control to IT departments, allowing them to manage the security of data and information services, but reducing the costs and complexities usually associated with site management and support.</p>
                  <p>To ensure data and content remains secure, IT administrators can also set permissions at document or item level, restricting who is able to access the information, and team members are able to create collaborative workplaces and tasks within prearranged constraints.</p>
                  <p>Our SharePoint service is easy to set up and can be connected across all your devices, including the SharePoint smartphone application. It can then be accessed from any location through an internet enabled device. Users are able to access an agreed amount of storage per site.</p>
                  <p>The service is maintained automatically by our experienced and professional team, so you can be safe in the knowledge that your businesses SharePoint service is running exactly how it should. If required, we can also provide 24/7 telephone support to ensure that, should any issues arise, users will be able to get back to full working standard as soon as possible.</p>
