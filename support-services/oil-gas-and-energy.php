                    IT Support services built for the Energy industry
                  </h1>
                  <p>At a basic level, IT Support services are critical for the Oil, Gas and energy sector for the same reasons other industries need IT support, to keep their business running smoothly in the event of an IT disaster and to minimise the revenue losses that can be caused by IT failure. On top of this there are many specific elements of IT Support that can be particularly useful for companies in the energy trade.</p>
                  <p>Stable IT systems have always been high on the priority list for Oil, Gas and Energy companies due to the high dependence that their day to day operations have on computer systems. This need was highlighted further in the aftermath of the Stuxnet attack in which critical plant control systems were affected by serious IT problems and very nearly caused disaster.</p>

                  <p>The fact that the data that is exchanged over IT Networks within Oil, Gas and Energy companies can potentially be worth millions of pounds is another reason why stable and secure IT systems are absolutely vital for companies in this sector.</p>
