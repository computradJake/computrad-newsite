                  <h2>Be alerted to network issues before your users become aware of them</h2>
                  <p>Most of Computrad’s clients choose our network monitoring service for one simple reason. Clients find that it is non-intrusive and reduces data loss, fault resolution times and ultimately increases network uptime. Constant monitoring of your network allows you to track trends which aid tracking of intermittent faults and then correcting them. Network monitoring has paid for itself many times over in reduced disruption and data loss, faster fault identification and fixing; and the ability to track network performance and plan accordingly.</p>
