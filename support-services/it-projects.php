                  <h2>Why should you engage Computrad for your IT Projects?</h2>
                  <p>We’re proud of our reputation as an industry leader in managed IT services and IT Projects. We’re Europe’s only officially-sanctioned network provider to the US Military, and we supply the US Army, Air Force and Navy with various IT solutions. The US Military is the worlds largest spender on IT and our efficiency when dealing with IT Projects has surpassed the very high standards set by the biggest spender on IT since 2003.</p>
                  <p>We specialise in network intergration and are a supplier of managed IT services and IT support services. In addition to this we provide best of breed vendor-agnostic solutions, specially tailored to our clients’ infrastructures.</p>
                  <p>Many other network integrators provide network installation and management without considering the software which is operating on them. This can lead to software not running anywhere near the optimum level meaning staff experience a lower quality network, resulting in negative effects on performance. Computrad's unique approach to IT Projects will result in a huge improvement to your IT uptime, efficiency and user satisfaction as well as helping IT and Security departments meet their targets.</p>

                  <h2>Computrad Application Centric Model (Layer 7)</h2>
                  <p>Traditionally organisations have made decisions which they classed as strategic such as deciding to invest in an MPLS network or standardising on the Microsoft Platform. In fact these were not strategic decisions at all but rather tactical decisions. This is because Microsoft could be substituted for Linux or MPLS for DSL and it would not dramatically affect the business. However to change the applications would affect the way the business operates.</p>
