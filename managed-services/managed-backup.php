                  <li>Reduce Your Day-to-Day Operating Costs: While most solutions require full backups periodically or in some cases daily, our solution only requires an initial full backup then from that point stores only incremental file changes and as it is cloud-based, it is saving you money in storage space, data transfer costs and server load</li>
                  <li>Safeguard Business Information: Since the solution takes backups in terms of changes, you will be able to recover files, even older revisions</li>
