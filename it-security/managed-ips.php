                  <h2>What is Managed IPS?</h2>
                  <p>Intrusion prevention is another service that is ideally located at the perimeter of your network. An Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) will take automatic action to shut down – attacks against your systems. Managed IPS maintenance and management allows you to avoid staffing concerns, such as the need for 24x7 monitoring by operators with specialized training and expertise. In addition, managed service providers gain experience with threat detection and analysis in multiple customer networks, increasing their value to you as informed providers of this vital functionality.</p>
                  <p>A centrally managed IPS monitored 24x7 provides you with a very high degree of protection against the dynamic threats facing modern networks. Being able to quickly lock-down segments of your network that may come under specific attack will allow other vital network functions to continue to operate – even under a sustained denial of service or virus attack.</p>
