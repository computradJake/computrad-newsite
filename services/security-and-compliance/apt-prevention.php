                  <h2>Computrad APT Prevention approach:</h2>
                  <p><b>Prevent Threats</b> – The threats will be detected and analysed in real time which will enable pro-active blocking and provide a high level of intelligence to understand the source of the attacks. This will enable constant ongoing protection and the system will get ‘smarter’ as more information about threats is logged.</p>
                  <p><b>Detect the threat</b> – The security threats we face today require a network architecture that has the ability to be aware of both multi-vector and multi-stage attacks. The Computrad APT solution can detect both known and evolving threats on a real time basis and can switch the protection to the correct load to match the demands of the network it is implemented within.</p>
                  <p><b>Contain the threat</b> – Containing security threats effectively requires live validation of the threats alongside the ability to put a stop to attacks when systems are compromised.</p>
                  <p><b>Resolve the threat</b> – Security threats will be examined, scoped and taken through to a resolution quickly in a way that is cost effective and that doesn’t impact on the flow of legitimate traffic.</p>
