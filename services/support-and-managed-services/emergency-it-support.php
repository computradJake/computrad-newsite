                  <p>However, if you've signed up for one of our IT Support packages, we'll send out an engineer as soon as we have one available – and if there's already one available, that'll be immediately!</p>

                  <p>We are able to provide an estimate based on time required for jobs of a similar nature. To ensure as accurate an estimate as possible, please provide as much information about the problem and your network set-up as you are able to. If you are unable to provide any information about your network – don't worry; we'll be able to work it out. We will not be able to supply an estimate in this case until an engineer has visited you on-site.</p>
