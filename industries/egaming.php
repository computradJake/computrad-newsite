                    eGaming Infrastructure Optimisation & DDoS Mitigation Solutions
                  </h1>
                  <p>As the Only Infrastructure and services partner for the US Department of Defence in Europe Computrad have developed skills in-house that were previously unknown to the commercial market, thus keeping our clients one step ahead of the competition all the time.</p>
                  <p>Computrad are the  only focused iGaming infrastructure specialist in the market sitting in a unique market space between a hosting provider and the software platform. Traditional hosting companies simply provide space and connectivity in a datacentre, whilst software platform vendors just provide the software with no regard to how it will perform optimally in the datacentre environment. Computrad optimise the datacentre environment and the software platform to enable a faster website response time for players, accelerate the software platform application and reduce credit card fraud with our unique solutions. Computrad have over five years of experience  in delivering and designing remote gaming solutions for the largest global iGaming  operators, and have helped new start-ups become some of the largest iGaming  operators in Europe in a very short time. </p>
