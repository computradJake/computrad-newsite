                  <h2>Fully managed DDoS mitigation, proactive monitoring 24/7/365</h2>
                  <p>Computrad’s managed DDoS mitigation service recognises malicious traffic and prevents it from gaining access to your services without preventing any legitimate requests. With its advanced detection abilities it can monitor and learn the normal, every day behaviour of your traffic. It then compares its findings with location data and uses local mitigation services to pre-emptively block potential attacks. The attacks are defeated before they ever reach you.</p>
                  <p>Our service actively searches out, identifies and negates threats before they ever reach your network, improving your network’s overall performance as a side-benefit, and analysing router and switch statistics to identify targeted attacks.</p>
                  <p>And it also learns your network’s behaviour, which enables it to detect and respond to any changes – even if the change indicates a completely new, never-before-seen attack. The data is fed back to our team of DDoS mitigation specialists who formulate your mitigation response strategies using our tried and tested methodologies.</p>
                  <p>The mitigator service then filters out the attack at the carrier without any adverse effects on your genuine traffic – saving your business from massive bandwidth costs.</p>

                  <h2>What are DDoS Attacks?</h2>
                  <p>DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) attacks are one of the biggest threats towards businesses today. And the threat is growing ever more complex and ever more damaging. A DDoS attack is when a ‘botnet’, a network of thousands of infected computers, targets a business or other organisation and makes a massive amount of requests. As the requests appear to be valid, the target site attempts to complete the requests and, as a result, becomes paralysed.</p>
                  <p>Our combination of advanced warning technology, trained and experienced security experts, and a massive, global infrastructure offers companies a fully adaptable solution that removes the need for costly investments with the future-proofing to enable it to cope with the kinds of scales of attacks that are likley to be developed in the future.</p>
