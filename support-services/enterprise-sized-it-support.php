                  <p>We’re  determined to impress our customers – not just with our speed and efficiency,  but also with the expert knowledge and professionalism of our staff. We’ll keep  you updated, and we’ll reduce your IT costs by a large percentage within the  first year of working together.</p>
                  <h2>You don’t need to wait 'til its too late</h2>
                  <p>Thanks  to our proactive monitoring and resolution, there’s no need to wait for your IT  to fail before it’s fixed. By that time, it’s too late. Your staff have lost  their work, they’re prevented from working effectively and achieving their targets;  productivity drops through the floor. And of course, your traditional IT  support provider is raking in more profits the more problems you have. In their  eyes, the longer they take to fix your kit, the better. Unlike the others, at Computrad  we do everything we can to make sure your network runs smoothly in the first place.</p>
                  <p>With  our Managed Services, you’ll benefit from  some of the quickest response times in the  industry, and our remote  helpdesk  provides a near instant response, with our qualified engineers ready to take  your call.</p>
