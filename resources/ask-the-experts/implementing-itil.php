                  <h2>The Issue</h2>
                  <p>Information systems are the lifeblood of many businesses. Your organisation has decided to implement the ITIL methodology to streamline the delivery of IT services in your company or organisation.</p>
                  <p>During this process there have been several meetings with the IT team, where the fundamental principles and objectives of the new approach have been highlighted, namely:</p>

                  <div class="col-md-6">

                  <li>Capacity management</li>
                  <li>Continuity management</li>
                  <li>Incident management</li>
                  <li>Supplier management</li>
                  </ul>
                  </div>
                  <div class="col-md-6">
                  <ul>
                  <li>Customer centric</li>
                  <li>Service level management</li>
                  <li>Configuration management</li>

                  </div>
                  <p>We have been told that availability, performance and costs need to be measured, agreed upon and then managed. These are all great ideas and appear to be useful, have nice concepts and buzzwords but how realistic are they when it comes to managing the WAN?</p>

                  <p>A network is probably one of the difficult parts of a business’s infrastructure. Normally it is where most individual components come together, where most changes can occur both short and long term, with new applications, application architecture consolidation, and the continuous evolution of the underlying technology is occurring. All these changes are occurring  and it’s a complex process.</p>
                  <p>It is therefore no surprise that it’s one of the most expensive and yet confused areas of IT. Its also not a surprise that IT is often being made a scapegoat.</p>

                  <h2>The Solution</h2>
                  <p>Computrad’s solution provides you with the above functionality. By using the Computrad solution in collaboration with application managers you can rank the importance of applications according to business defined needs and then define the service levels you want to obtain. The Computrad system will then use its optimisation function to guarantee the performance of the critical applications and alert you in real-time if the service levels of the less-critical applications are not achieved. Also by utilising our service you can easily find out how much bandwidth is required for a given level of service to allows the applications to perform. In this way you are clearly demonstrating a relationship between application performance and cost.</p>
                  <p>The solution will allow you to setup a monitor of the different components of the application delivery chain, including for example the MPLS VPN service provided by your service provider.</p>
                  <p>The Computrad solution will seamlessly manage any changes by automatically adapting to evolving network conditions such as remotely working and constantly mobile end users, new application roll-outs and so on while still meeting desired business critical application performance objectives.</p>
