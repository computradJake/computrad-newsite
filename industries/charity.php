                    Cost Effective IT Support for your Charity
                  </h1>
                    <p>Computrad provide specialist IT Support services to a number of charities and not for profit organisations throughout the UK.</p>
                    <p>As an IT Support provider, we have an excellent understanding of the financial constraints that charities are under in order to operate efficiently. By utilising IT Support that has been specifically designed for charities, internal staff can focus on running the charity and generating money rather than worrying about IT issues causing problems.</p>
                    <p>We will work to get the most out of the existing IT infrastructure to ensure that the system is able to play a big part in ensuring that the charity generates more donations and getting these donations to the right people.</p>
