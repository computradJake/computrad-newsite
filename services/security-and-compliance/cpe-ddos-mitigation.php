                  <p>CPE (Customer premises equipment) based DDoS Mitigation is when an onsite device is used to detect and mitigate distributed denial of service attacks on a business network.</p>
                  <p>Computrad CPE DDoS utilises real time detection of suspicious signatures on the network to provide protection against known threats. The system will also detect and mitigate emerging threats in real time without requiring the input of a human and without causing disruption to legitimate network traffic.</p>

                  <h2>Fully managed DDoS mitigation, proactive monitoring 24/7/365</h2>
                  <p>Computrad’s managed DDoS mitigation service recognises malicious traffic and prevents it from gaining access to your services without preventing any legitimate requests. With its advanced detection abilities it can monitor and learn the normal, every day behaviour of your traffic. It then compares its findings with location data and uses local mitigation services to pre-emptively block potential attacks. The attacks are defeated before they ever reach you.</p>
                  <p>Our service actively searches out, identifies and negates threats before they ever reach your network, improving your network’s overall performance as a side-benefit, and analysing router and switch statistics to identify targeted attacks.</p>
                  <p>And it also learns your network’s behaviour, which enables it to detect and respond to any changes – even if the change indicates a completely new, never-before-seen attack. The data is fed back to our team of DDoS mitigation specialists who formulate your mitigation response strategies using our tried and tested methodologies.</p>
                  <p>The mitigator service then filters out the attack at the carrier without any adverse effects on your genuine traffic – saving your business from massive bandwidth costs.</p>
