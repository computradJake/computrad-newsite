              <p>Due to the increasing use of computer controlled manufacturing techniques and automation within the industry, IT systems within have evolved to be a mission critical part of manufacturing organisations.</p>
              <p>If IT systems were to fail, the potential for a mass slowdown in manufacturing or even a complete standstill is very likely. This means that manufacturing organisations need to have enterprise standard IT support in place to ensure that this does not happen.</p>
              <p>At Computrad, we have developed many of our IT Support services to match the mission critical model that is evident in many industries today. We understand the IT systems are the lifeblood of the organisation and will utilise our technologies and experience to deliver an IT Support service to keep your IT systems and more importantly your manufacturing process, running smoothly.</p>
