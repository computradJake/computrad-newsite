                  <h2>Sync all your network resources</h2>
                  <p>Our Hosted Exchange service allows you to synchronise your Microsoft services, including Outlook, to keep you up and running wherever you are. You can continue to work with your colleagues around the room, the country or the world using shared content, which will sync straight back to your laptop, smartphone and tablet.</p>
                  <p>By making use of our Hosted Exchange service, you will receive custom mailboxes directed through your business domain. Another key feature of our service is data retrieval, a very valuable tool for businesses that may have critical information sent via email. Our service enables mail messages to be restored up to 14 days after being deleted, whilst entire mailboxes can be restored up to 30 days after being deleted.</p>
                  <p>Our Hosted Exchange service can be easily implemented with your existing setup, without the need to update your whole network or system. Your phone can be connected with your mail service, and there’s no need to lose all your old work and emails, as migration can be easily handled either through our migration tool, or by letting our expert team handle all the setup work on your behalf.</p>
